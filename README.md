Key Features and Functionality

1. Citizen Data Collection via Google Forms

A user-friendly Google Form serves as the primary interface for citizens to input their details.

Information collected includes name, contact details, address, Aadhar number, occupation, and specific needs or concerns.

Citizens can also select relevant schemes they are interested in or request assistance for specific issues.



2. Data Management and Integration using Google Sheets

The data submitted through Google Forms is automatically stored and organized in Google Sheets.

Custom scripts written in Google Apps Script (JavaScript) enhance the sheet's functionality, enabling sorting, filtering, and real-time updates.

Sheets are secured to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of citizen data.



3. Admin Dashboard for BJP Leaders

Developed using JavaScript and Visual Studio, the dashboard acts as a centralized portal for BJP leaders and their teams.

Leaders can view, filter, and analyze citizen data to identify common needs and prioritize areas of focus.

The dashboard includes features like:

Search and filter options for quick access to specific entries.

Real-time updates synced with Google Sheets.

Graphical representations of data for better decision-making (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs).




4. Scheme Mapping and Recommendation

The system maps citizens' details to relevant government schemes based on their demographics, needs, and requests.

Leaders can generate a list of schemes and facilities tailored to individual citizens or groups.

Automated notifications or emails can be sent to citizens informing them about the schemes they are eligible for.



5. Follow-Up and Feedback Mechanism

Leaders can track the progress of assistance provided to citizens and mark statuses (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed").

Citizens can provide feedback on the support received, helping leaders evaluate and improve the system.



6. Scalability and Versatility

The system can be scaled to include more features, such as integration with Aadhaar and voter ID databases for verification.

It can be adapted for use in different regions or constituencies, ensuring flexibility.
